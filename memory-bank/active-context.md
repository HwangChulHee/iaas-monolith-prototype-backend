## Current Session Notes

- [11:55:51 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Architectural Weakness: Inefficient VM Listing (N+1 Problem)
- [11:55:51 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Architectural Weakness: Synchronous API Processing
- [11:55:51 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Architectural Weakness: Lack of Rollback Logic
- [11:55:35 AM] [Unknown User] Completed Project Phase 1 (MVP): Phase 1 (MVP) is complete. Implemented core VM management APIs (create, delete, list) using Python, WSGI, and libvirt. The system can now create a VM from a template, delete it (including disk image), and list VMs with their real-time status from libvirt.


## Ongoing Tasks

- Complete VM lifecycle management (start, shutdown, reboot).


## Known Issues

- Lack of rollback logic for atomic operations.
- Synchronous processing for long-running tasks.
- N+1 query problem in the VM listing API.


## Next Steps

- Implement `POST /v1/vms/{vm_name}/start` API.
- Implement `POST /v1/vms/{vm_name}/shutdown` API.
- Implement `POST /v1/vms/{vm_name}/reboot` API.
