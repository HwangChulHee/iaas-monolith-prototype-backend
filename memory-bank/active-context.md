## Current Session Notes

- [3:50:17 PM] [Unknown User] test(ComputeService): Add failure case tests for create_vm: Added two new test cases for create_vm: fails if the name already exists, and fails if the base image is not found. This improves the test coverage for the core VM creation logic.
- [12:45:44 PM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Makefile Test Workflow Structure
- [12:45:26 PM] [Unknown User] feat(test): ComputeService 단위 테스트 추가 및 Makefile 개선: Added unit tests for ComputeService (`list_vms`) and significantly improved the Makefile testing workflow (`test-all`, `test file=...`). Established a foundation for TDD.
- [11:55:51 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Architectural Weakness: Inefficient VM Listing (N+1 Problem)
- [11:55:51 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Architectural Weakness: Synchronous API Processing
- [11:55:51 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Architectural Weakness: Lack of Rollback Logic
- [11:55:35 AM] [Unknown User] Completed Project Phase 1 (MVP): Phase 1 (MVP) is complete. Implemented core VM management APIs (create, delete, list) using Python, WSGI, and libvirt. The system can now create a VM from a template, delete it (including disk image), and list VMs with their real-time status from libvirt.


## Ongoing Tasks

- Complete VM lifecycle management (start, shutdown, reboot).


## Known Issues

- Lack of rollback logic for atomic operations.
- Synchronous processing for long-running tasks.
- N+1 query problem in the VM listing API.


## Next Steps

- Write unit tests for `create_vm` method.
- Write unit tests for `destroy_vm` method.
