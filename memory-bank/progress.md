# Progress Log



## Update History

- [2025-10-04 3:50:17 PM] [Unknown User] - test(ComputeService): Add failure case tests for create_vm: Added two new test cases for create_vm: fails if the name already exists, and fails if the base image is not found. This improves the test coverage for the core VM creation logic.
- [2025-10-04 12:45:44 PM] [Unknown User] - Decision Made: Makefile Test Workflow Structure
- [2025-10-04 12:45:26 PM] [Unknown User] - feat(test): ComputeService 단위 테스트 추가 및 Makefile 개선: Added unit tests for ComputeService (`list_vms`) and significantly improved the Makefile testing workflow (`test-all`, `test file=...`). Established a foundation for TDD.
- [2025-10-04 11:55:51 AM] [Unknown User] - Decision Made: Architectural Weakness: Inefficient VM Listing (N+1 Problem)
- [2025-10-04 11:55:51 AM] [Unknown User] - Decision Made: Architectural Weakness: Synchronous API Processing
- [2025-10-04 11:55:51 AM] [Unknown User] - Decision Made: Architectural Weakness: Lack of Rollback Logic
- [2025-10-04 11:55:35 AM] [Unknown User] - Completed Project Phase 1 (MVP): Phase 1 (MVP) is complete. Implemented core VM management APIs (create, delete, list) using Python, WSGI, and libvirt. The system can now create a VM from a template, delete it (including disk image), and list VMs with their real-time status from libvirt.
